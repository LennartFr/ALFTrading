### You can not beat the market, at least not regularly.	

Over time the stock market will go up, as a result o the fact that most economies will grow overtime.
It’s  well neigh impossible to beat the market over time. In fact, all of the data  show that a tiny percentage of professional investors are able to do it with at least some degree of consistency. It is possible for you to find one of those professionals and invest with him or her, or to be one of those investors yourself. But it’s incredibly unlikely.

## Buying and selling stocks and shares on Stock Exchanges.	

A stock exchange, securities exchange, or bourse is a facility where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell securities, such as shares of stock and bonds and other financial instruments. 

Stock exchanges may also provide facilities for the issue and redemption of such securities and instruments and capital events including the payment of income and dividends. 

Securities traded on a stock exchange include stock issued by listed companies, unit trusts, derivatives, pooled investment products and bonds. 

Stock exchanges often function as "continuous auction" markets with buyers and sellers consummating transactions via open outcry at a central location such as the floor of the exchange or by using an electronic trading platform.
