This little monograph is an  introduction to investing in the US stock market.  The most important thing to remember when we start  investing is that while we can make money in the stock market  we can also lose money in the stock market. 

The best strategy for the beginner is therefore to minimize the risks of losing money while at the same time maximizing the chances of making money. We will spell this out as we go along.

## Trading concepts  

One of the most important principles for investing is that nobody can beat the market in the long run.
To learn more about this principle read up on Bernie Madoff https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Madoff

## Compound Interest.	

Compound interest is the most important principle of investing. It says that if you invest and actively keep investing over several years, the interest on your investment will grow exponentially, as the picture below illustrates. Of course, as always, you can also risk losing money.
Your investment strategy should  be to minimize your losses and maximize your gains

## Active investment vs. passive investment	
Active investing refers to an investment strategy that involves ongoing buying and selling activity by the investor. Active investors purchase investments and continuously monitor their activity to exploit profitable conditions. Active investing is highly involved and goes under the name of Day Trading.

## You can not beat the market, at least not regularly.	



Given enough time, the stock market will inveriably go up, given the fact that most economies will grow over time.
A rorolaggy it thay it’s  well neigh impossible to beat the market over time. In fact, only a tiny percentage of professional investors are able to do so with at least some degree of consistency. It is not impossible for you to find one of these superprofessionals and invest with him or her, or to become one of those investors yourself. But it’s incredibly unlikely.

## Day Trading, don't even think of doing it.

Day trading is speculation in securities, specifically buying and selling financial instruments within the same trading day, such that all positions are closed before the market closes for the trading day. You will not make mnoney Day Trading so don't even think about

## Major components of the trading system:

# Stock Indexes
Stock Indexes help investors compare current price levels with past prices to calculate market performance.	
 There are three major stock indexes in the US, all located in 
 

##  1) Dow Jones Industrial Average <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=djia&sxsrf=ALeKk00iWQnlfeU0c-s6bwXPb9ytoDzoNA%3A1624128613434&source=hp&ei=ZTzOYMfRF46V-wSwrpS4BA&iflsig=AINFCbYAAAAAYM5KdTXXQSUYdpAzty1cGgQDN9VOIDhe&oq=djia"> The Dow Jones Industrial Average </a>(DJIA), Dow Jones, is a price-weighted measurement stock market index of the 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.

## 2) <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/">NASDAQ</a>,	

The Nasdaq Stock Market is an American stock exchange based in New York City. It is ranked second on the list of stock exchanges by market capitalization of shares traded, behind the New York Stock Exchange.

## <a href="https://www.nyse.com/index">The New York Stock Exchange</a> in New York City,

## We buy and sell shares on Stock Exchanges through brokerage houses.	

So we begin by setting up an account with an investment app such as:

Brokerage Houses such as:

# J.P. Morgan
# Charles Schwab
# Golman Sachs
# Merrill Lynch
# City Bank
# Bank of America

# <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/home">Vanguard</a>, investment advisor

Brokers from authorized brokeragehouses do the actual buying and selling on the floor at the various Stock Exchanges. You as an investor enter your buy and sell orders in your brokerage account that you have set up with a brokerage firm. You pay the brokerage firm a small sum for each trade.

Up intil a few years ago brokerage houses were fully manned by human brokers. But in the last few years computerized Robo-advisers, which
provide digital financial advice based on mathematical algorithms have become increasingly prevalent. These algorithms are executed by software and thus financial advice does not require a human advisor. The software utilizes its algorithms to automatically allocate, manage and optimize clients' assets.

The success of the robo-avise technology has let the traditional brokerhouses to also adopt the new technologies.

## Trading Strategies	

What can we trade on the stockmarket?

We don't usually trade individual stocks. instead we trade something called Funds, Indexes and ETF's - which stands for "Exchangnge Traded Funds".	

## Mutual Funds. 
A mutual fund is an open-end professionally managed investment fund that pools money from many investors to purchase securities. These investors may be retail or institutional in nature. The term is typically used in the United States, Canada, and India, while similar structures across the globe include the SICAV in Europe ('investment company with variable capital') and open-ended investment company (OEIC) in the UK.

## Index Funds. 
An index fund (also index tracker) is a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) designed to follow certain preset rules so that the fund can track a specified basket of underlying investments. Those rules may include tracking prominent indexes like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average or implementation rules, such as tax-management, tracking error minimization, large block trading or patient/flexible trading strategies that allows for greater tracking error, but lower market impact costs. Index funds may also have rules that screen for social and sustainable criteria.	

## ETF Funds. 
An exchange-traded fund is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and generally operates with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep it trading close to its net asset value, although deviations can occasionally occur. Most ETFs track an index, such as a stock index or bond index. ETFs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs, tax efficiency, and stock-like features 


Invesco QQQ is an exchange-traded fund based on the Nasdaq-100 Index®. The Fund will, under most circumstances, consist of all of stocks in the Index. The Index includes 100 of the largest domestic and international nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market based on market capitalization. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced quarterly and reconstituted annually.

Expect more success in the long run.

## Fractional Shares and Fractional Trading

The easiest way to think about fractional trading is what happens without it. Without fractional trading the smallest amount you can buy of an investment is generally a single share. For big investors and institutions that’s generally fine, they are trading in amounts where they are always buying large amounts of shares and so the need to buy less than a share seldom happens. However, for a smaller investor, especially one looking to diversify, buying companies with share prices over $1,000 becomes a major undertaking.

With fractional trading you don’t need to do that. Rather than fork out almost $3,000 for a share of Amazon AMZN -0.5%, for example, you can now just purchase an amount less than that. If you want $100 of Amazon, you can buy it and you’ll end up with fraction of a share of Amazon. That is to say that you’ll pay your $100 and you’ll receive about 0.038 of an Amazon share at the time of writing. Then that fraction of a share will move just as other Amazon shares do.
